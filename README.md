# BurpFinder500
BurpFinder500 is a Burp extension developed to store 500 errors during an analysis.
## Installation
We can add the plugin from the Burp Extensions section.
## How to use
Once installed, after detecting a response from the server with a 500 error, an issue with a High severity will be logged.

This functionality is associated with active Burp scanning, so if a 500 error is detected, it will automatically be logged.
